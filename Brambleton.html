        <h3><b><i>Current Status</i></b></h3>
        <p> Starting April 1st NOVA Parks will begin charging an additional fee for single rider golf carts. 
            This fee is due to the additional costs associated with providing single rider carts and availability. 
            We will continue to maintain our heightened sanitation practices in an effort to keep the carts and our facilities as safe as possible. 
            If you have any questions, please contact the golf pro shop.
        </p>
        <p>
            General Info: All NOVA Golf Courses are open and operating during normal business hours. 
            We ask that you please consider the following information:
        </p>
        <h3><b><i>Social Distancing</i></b></h3>
        <p> 
            In an effort to protect the health and safety of our employees and guests, 
            we are following Social Distancing Standards recommended by the Center for Disease Control.
            These standards will be strictly enforced without exception.
        </p>
        <h3><b><i>Sanitation</i></b></h3>
        <p>
            In addition to social distancing our facilities are increasing sanitation practices including
            but not limited to wiping down range buckets, pull carts, counters, credit card key pads, 
            door handles and all other common touch points on site. The sanitation measures are for our
            guests protection as well as the protection of our employees. Riding cart use is limited to 
            single riders only (unless guests are from the same household). We appreciate your patience 
            and understanding as our employees diligently work to provide a safe environment for everyone.
            For additional questions please contact the golf shop directly.
        </p>
