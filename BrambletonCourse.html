        <h3><b><i>About</i></b></h3>
        <p>
            Enjoy the grandeur and beauty of Brambleton Golf Course, located in Ashburn, 
            just off the Dulles Greenway. Brambleton measures almost 6800 total yards from the back tees,
            and features several tiered greens, as well as significant water in play on six holes
            from the front nine, as well as two on the back. Signature holes include number 7 – 
            a par 5 almost 600 yards from the back tees with a narrow landing area off the tee, and  
            number 12, a 145-160 yard par 3, with a beautiful downhill shot to a green surrounded on 
            three sides by water. Brambleton is open daily (weather permitting), and tee times are 
            encouraged, though not required. The site features a club house as well as the Brambleton Ale 
            House, and a full pro shop. Encounter wildlife as you walk the rolling terrain, which 
            features bunkered greens and fairways, large sand traps, and smooth putting greens.

        <p>
            Designed by William H. “Hank” Hank Gordon, Brambleton Golf Course opened in 1994. 
            Gordon is responsible for more than $10 billion worth of engineering management services. 
            However, only a select few of those projects were golf courses. He also has participated 
            in various aspects of the design for 16 other golf course projects in Virginia and Maryland.
